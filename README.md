# Technical Test Fergus

## Getting Started
I time-boxed this challenge and allowed myself 2.5 hours to write the code and 0.5 hours to write the README. This means that I didn't finish the challenge as I run out of time. But that's ok, I didn't want to give you a wrong impression of building a completed app but in reality it took me a day (or days).

I decided to build the front-end of the app as I enjoy it the most and would like to develop my skills. Furthermore I decided to use redux as I wanted to practice it some more. I made the following assumptions:

- database will be written on the server side using knex/mysql3 consisting of 2 tables, one for the job listings and one for the notes (one to many relationship).

- bold assumption that my code works :-) To be honest I've never had to build just the front-end without building the back-end at the same time. I don't know how to test my code without having the back-end ready. I need to do some research on how to do this. I believe there is a way to mock the data. I'm super curious now and will try to do it after submitting this challenge.

## Process
I decided on a MVP and came to the conclusion that, from a user's perspective, the most important feature would be to see a list with all the jobs and be able to click on a listing and see the details.

After I completed the MVP, I worked on the filter feature. If I were a tradie, I would want to filter the jobs by status. This feature took me quite a long time as it was complex and redux confused me with the state management :-)

I didn't have time to work on another feature unfortunately. Next I would have worked on the edit notes / change status features. I would have created an UpdateJobListing component and would have created a controlled form to update the notes and updating the status using radio buttons. And then write the actions and reducers of course.
